# Sales-Data-Analysis.
My First Excel Project.

📈 Exited to share a snapshot of my First Ever Excel Dashboard showcasing SK Store Insights. 🚀 

I worked on a comprehensive Sales Data Analysis project and I'm thrilled to share the insights and visualizations derived from the dataset. Here's a summary of what I accomplished :

Sales and Order Analysis: :
Created a detailed Custom Combination Chart of Sales and Order covering the data month wise. This visualisation provides a clear view of comparison between Sales and Order Generated in a particular month and which month got the Highest Sales and Orders. 💵💳

Gender Segment Analysis :
Analyzed Customers Segments on the basis of their Gender to understand their contribution to overall sales in a whole year.🤵🧕

Order Status Insights :
Identified the status of all order which are placed in the whole year, the order status is divided in four categories.
1) Delivered 2) Returned 3) Refunded 4) Cancelled 
A Pie chart provide us details of Order status in percentage form.🛒🛍

Sales and State Trends :
Detailed Bar Chart helping with the insights that which state have maximum number of Sales Amount Done in the complete year.
We gathered top 5 states which have maximum numbers of Sales in the Year of 2022.📊🌎 

Customer Segments Analysis ( with Age Group ) :
In this Analysis, first we distribute the Age column in Three Categories 1) Senior 2) Adult 3) Teenager. And on the basis of these three categories we created a Clustered Column Chart which Shows us the Age Group of Customer with their Gender and their Percentage of Order.🧒🧑🧓

Channel Trends :
Again I use Pie chart for better visuality creating to know which channel have maximum no. Of order sales and which have lesser amount of orders.
We have different Channels in our data where those channels help us to increase our sales by online method. 💻 🛒 

Apart from this KPI's , I added Slicing in my Dashboard which help us to see the data of parti cular month or particular channel or the data of Particular Product, as the Dashboard is completly designed in Excel and it is totally Dynamic. ⚖💷

With a user-friendly interface and Interactive features, it's easier than ever tk analyse trends, spots opportunies, and optimize our strategies.
I also Added my Insight which will be helpful for SK Store if they work on those parameters the Sales will definitely touch the sky for upcoming year.💰💰

This project has deepened my understanding of sales data analysis, visualization techniques and deriving actionable business insights.Feel free to check out the dashboard for detailed view of the analysis.
